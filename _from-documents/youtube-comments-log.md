## Videos 2 & 3 — ⚠️ Blocked (YouTube Rendering Issue)

### Root Cause:
YouTube's comment input box (`ytd-comment-simplebox-renderer`) failed to render in the automated browser session for all subsequent page navigations. This is caused by YouTube's **IntersectionObserver-based lazy loading** — the comment section only renders when it enters the viewport, but this trigger doesn't fire reliably in the headless/automated browser context beyond the initial page load.

### Approaches Tried (all failed):
- JavaScript `window.scrollTo()` to scroll to comment section
- Dismissing YouTube's TV dialog before scrolling
- Dispatching `scroll`, `yt-navigate-finish`, `yt-page-data-updated` events
- Triggering IntersectionObserver manually
- Using YouTube's internal innertube API (`/youtubei/v1/next`) to find comment params
- Searching `ytInitialData` for `createCommentParams` token
- Multiple fresh page navigations to different videos

---

## Fix for Next Run

**Enable Computer Use** in Settings → Desktop app → Computer Use.
With physical mouse simulation, YouTube's lazy loading triggers correctly (scroll events are real), allowing the comment box to appear and be interacted with on any video.

Alternatively, the scheduled task will retry tomorrow with fresh browser state, which may resolve the rendering issue naturally.
