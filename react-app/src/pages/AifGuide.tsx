    correctWhy: 'Retrieves live company data at inference time. Always current. No retraining needed. 10-100x cheaper.',
    tip: 'RAG = knowledge updates. Fine-tuning = style/format/behavior changes. If the question mentions "current data" or "up-to-date" → RAG always wins.',

    wrongWhy: 'SageMaker is for training and hosting custom models. It requires ML expertise, infrastructure setup, and model management.',

    correctWhy: 'Bedrock is the serverless FM API. You call Claude, Titan, Llama via API — zero infrastructure. Bedrock = managed FMs.',
    tip: 'SageMaker = build/train/host YOUR model. Bedrock = use AMAZON\'S or third-party FMs via API. Never confuse these two on the exam.',

    trigger: '"make the model more deterministic" or "reduce randomness in responses"',
    wrong: 'Decrease Top-P to 0',
    wrongWhy: 'Top-P (nucleus sampling) controls vocabulary breadth — how many tokens are considered. It\'s a secondary creativity control.',
    correct: 'Decrease Temperature toward 0',
    correctWhy: 'Temperature is the primary randomness lever. Temperature = 0 → most deterministic, always picks highest probability token.',
    tip: 'Temperature = how wild the model is. Top-P = how many words it considers. For determinism → Temperature. For focused vocab → Top-P. Temperature is tested more.',

    correctWhy: 'Guardrails inspect model input and output. Denied Topics block specific subject matter at the infrastructure level before responses reach users.',

    correctWhy: 'Agents orchestrate multi-step workflows. They call action groups (Lambda functions), query Knowledge Bases, and chain multiple steps together.',
    tip: 'Knowledge Bases = read only. Agents = read + act. If the scenario involves DOING something (calling API, writing data, sending notification) → Agents.',

    correctWhy: 'Embeddings capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts are close in vector space regardless of exact words used.',
    tip: '"Semantic search" or "find similar meaning" always points to embeddings + vector store. Keyword search is NOT semantic search.',

    title: 'Responsible AI — bias fix',
    icon: '⚖️',
    trigger: '"ensure our model doesn\'t discriminate" or "hiring AI shows bias toward certain groups"',
    wrong: 'Add more training data to fix bias',
    wrongWhy: 'If the additional data has the same bias patterns, adding more data amplifies rather than fixes the problem.',
    correct: 'SageMaker Clarify for bias detection + human review workflow (A2I)',
    correctWhy: 'Clarify detects pre/post-training bias with statistical measures. A2I adds human oversight for high-stakes decisions.',
    tip: 'More data ≠ less bias. You need bias DETECTION first (Clarify), then targeted data correction + human oversight (A2I). Both are tested.',

    icon: '💉',
    trigger: '"user is overriding the system prompt" or "adversarial input hijacking the AI\'s behavior"',

    correctWhy: 'Guardrails provide infrastructure-level filtering. System prompt in separate API field (not concatenated). Agents with minimal permissions limit blast radius.',

    icon: '🎯',
    trigger: '"improve response quality without retraining the model"',

    correctWhy: 'Prompt engineering changes model behavior with zero model changes. Few-shot examples guide format and quality at inference time.',
    tip: '"Without retraining" → prompt engineering always. RLHF, fine-tuning, and continued pre-training all involve retraining. Know the distinction.',

    title: 'Token cost optimization',
    icon: '💰',
    trigger: '"reduce cost of FM calls" or "API costs are too high"',
    wrong: 'Use a smaller context window',
    wrongWhy: 'Context window is a model capability limit, not a cost dial you set. Truncating context randomly degrades quality unpredictably.',
    correct: 'Use smaller model (Haiku/Lite) + optimize prompt efficiency + Batch Inference for async workloads',
    correctWhy: 'Model size is the #1 cost driver. Concise prompts reduce input tokens. Batch Inference cuts costs up to 50% for non-real-time jobs.',
    tip: 'Cost levers in order: (1) smaller model, (2) fewer tokens in prompt, (3) Batch Inference. Context window ≠ cost control.',

    icon: '📚',
    trigger: '"model doesn\'t understand our industry terminology" vs "model doesn\'t follow our response format"',

    wrongWhy: 'These are different problems requiring different fine-tuning types. Using the wrong type wastes compute and produces poor results.',
    correct: 'Domain terminology → Continued pre-training. Response format/style → Instruction fine-tuning',
    correctWhy: 'Continued pre-training exposes model to domain text to learn vocabulary. Instruction fine-tuning trains on input→output pairs to shape behavior.',
    tip: 'Domain knowledge gaps → continued pre-training. Behavior/format issues → instruction fine-tuning. Both still lose to RAG for factual knowledge updates.',
