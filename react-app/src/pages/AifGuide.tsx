    correctWhy: 'Bedrock is the serverless FM API. You call Claude, Titan, Llama via API — zero infrastructure. Bedrock = managed FMs.',

    correct: 'Decrease Temperature toward 0',
    correctWhy: 'Temperature is the primary randomness lever. Temperature = 0 → most deterministic, always picks highest probability token.',
    tip: 'Temperature = how wild the model is. Top-P = how many words it considers. For determinism → Temperature. For focused vocab → Top-P. Temperature is tested more.',

    correctWhy: 'Guardrails inspect model input and output. Denied Topics block specific subject matter at the infrastructure level before responses reach users.',

    correctWhy: 'Continued pre-training exposes model to domain text to learn vocabulary. Instruction fine-tuning trains on input→output pairs to shape behavior.',
