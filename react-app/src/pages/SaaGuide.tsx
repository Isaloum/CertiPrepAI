    trigger: '"Improve RDS performance" or "too many read queries slowing DB"',
    wrong: 'Enable RDS Multi-AZ',
    wrongWhy: 'Multi-AZ standby is completely inaccessible for reads. It only exists for failover. You cannot route any traffic to it.',
    correct: 'Create RDS Read Replicas',
    correctWhy: 'Read Replicas receive async copies and can serve SELECT queries, offloading read pressure from the primary instance.',
    tip: 'Multi-AZ = High Availability (DR/failover). Read Replicas = Performance (read scaling). These solve different problems and are never interchangeable on the exam.',
  },

    title: 'Security Groups cannot Deny — only NACLs can',
    icon: '🛡️',
    trigger: '"Block a specific IP address" or "deny traffic from CIDR range"',
    wrong: 'Add a Deny rule to the Security Group',
    wrongWhy: 'Security Groups are allow-only. There is no Deny rule option. All traffic that does not match an allow rule is implicitly denied.',
    correct: 'Add a Deny rule to the Network ACL',
    correctWhy: 'NACLs support explicit Allow AND Deny rules, processed in numeric order. Block the IP at the subnet boundary.',
    tip: 'SG = stateful (return traffic auto-allowed), allow-only, instance level. NACL = stateless (must allow both directions), allow+deny, subnet level.',

    title: 'Direct Connect is NOT encrypted by default',
    icon: '🔌',
    trigger: '"Dedicated private connection with encryption"',

    wrongWhy: 'Direct Connect provides a dedicated private fiber connection but the traffic is NOT encrypted. It is private but not secured.',
    correct: 'Direct Connect + Site-to-Site VPN (IPSec over DX)',
    correctWhy: 'Run an IPSec VPN tunnel over the Direct Connect connection to get both consistent dedicated bandwidth AND encryption.',
    tip: 'Any question mentioning both "dedicated/consistent" AND "encrypted" → DX + VPN. DX alone = private. VPN alone = encrypted but variable latency.',

    correct: 'S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier (multi-AZ)',
    correctWhy: 'Both replicate across 3+ AZs. Legal and compliance data must survive AZ failures. Never One Zone-IA for irreplaceable data.',
    tip: 'One Zone-IA is ONLY appropriate for reproducible data (thumbnails, transcoded media) or secondary backups. Any mention of "compliance" or "legal" eliminates it.',

    title: 'Spot Instances can be interrupted — not for critical workloads',
    icon: '💸',
    trigger: '"Most cost-effective" for stateful, critical, or DB workloads',
    wrong: 'Spot Instances for production database or payment processing',
    wrongWhy: 'AWS can terminate Spot Instances with a 2-minute warning when EC2 capacity is reclaimed. Data loss and downtime for stateful apps.',
    correct: 'Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for steady-state; On-Demand for critical unpredictable',
    correctWhy: 'Reserved Instances give up to 72% discount with guaranteed capacity. Savings Plans are flexible across instance families.',
    tip: 'Spot = stateless, fault-tolerant, flexible (batch, rendering, big data). If the word "database", "payment", "critical", or "stateful" appears → eliminate Spot.',

    icon: '🌍',
    trigger: '"Route based on user location" vs "route to fastest region"',
    wrong: 'Geolocation routing for performance optimization',
    wrongWhy: 'Geolocation routes based on WHERE the user is (country/continent/state). It does NOT consider network latency or connection speed.',
    correct: 'Latency routing for performance, Geolocation for compliance/content control',
    correctWhy: 'Latency routing measures actual network latency to AWS regions. A user in London might go to us-east-1 if latency is lower there.',
    tip: '"Users in Germany MUST always use EU servers" → Geolocation (compliance). "Route users to the fastest region" → Latency (performance). "Must" = Geolocation.',

    title: 'Cannot encrypt existing RDS instance in-place',
    icon: '🔐',
    trigger: '"Enable encryption on existing unencrypted RDS instance"',
    wrong: 'Enable encryption on the running RDS instance via console',
    wrongWhy: 'RDS encryption must be set at creation time. You cannot toggle encryption on an existing instance — the option does not exist.',
    correct: 'Snapshot → copy snapshot with encryption → restore to new instance → update endpoint',
    correctWhy: 'AWS documented migration path. Take snapshot, copy it enabling encryption, restore from encrypted snapshot, then do cutover.',

    title: 'NAT Gateway must be in the PUBLIC subnet',
    icon: '🔀',
    trigger: 'Private subnet instances need internet access',
    wrong: 'Place NAT Gateway in the private subnet',
    wrongWhy: 'NAT Gateway itself needs internet access (to forward traffic) so it must have a route to an Internet Gateway — which means public subnet.',
    correct: 'NAT Gateway in PUBLIC subnet; private subnet route table points to NAT GW',
    correctWhy: 'Traffic flow: Private EC2 → NAT GW (public subnet) → IGW → Internet. For AZ resilience: one NAT GW per AZ.',
    tip: 'For high availability: one NAT Gateway PER Availability Zone. A single NAT GW is a single point of failure for private subnets in other AZs.',

    wrongWhy: 'CloudFront is HTTP/HTTPS only. IPs are dynamic (DNS-based). Cannot handle raw TCP/UDP traffic.',
    correct: 'Global Accelerator for TCP/UDP, static IPs, or non-cacheable dynamic content',
    correctWhy: 'Global Accelerator provides 2 static Anycast IPs and routes TCP/UDP over AWS backbone to your endpoints.',
    tip: '"Whitelist IPs at corporate firewall" → Global Accelerator (static IPs). "Cache images globally" → CloudFront. "Gaming/VoIP/IoT" → Global Accelerator.',

    correct: 'AWS Secrets Manager',
    correctWhy: 'Secrets Manager has built-in native rotation for RDS, Redshift, and DocumentDB with pre-built Lambda rotation functions.',
    tip: 'The word "rotation" always points to Secrets Manager. Parameter Store = free config/secrets storage, no rotation. Cost: ~$0.40/secret/month for Secrets Manager.',

  {
    title: 'Messages processed twice = visibility timeout too short',
    icon: '📨',
    trigger: '"SQS messages are being processed more than once"',
    wrong: 'Switch from Standard to FIFO queue',
    wrongWhy: 'FIFO gives exactly-once processing but has throughput limits (300 msg/sec). The root cause here is a timeout issue, not ordering.',
    correct: 'Increase the SQS visibility timeout',
    correctWhy: 'If processing takes longer than the timeout, the message reappears for another consumer. Set timeout > max processing time.',
    tip: 'Visibility timeout should exceed your worst-case processing time. If Lambda can take up to 5 min, set visibility timeout to 6+ minutes.',

    title: 'VPC Peering is non-transitive — use Transit Gateway for scale',
    icon: '🔗',
    trigger: '"Connect 5+ VPCs" or "hub-and-spoke" or "transitive routing"',
    wrong: 'VPC Peering for large multi-VPC architectures',
    wrongWhy: 'VPC Peering is non-transitive. A↔B and B↔C does NOT mean A↔C. With 10 VPCs you need 45 peering connections.',
    correct: 'Transit Gateway',
    correctWhy: 'TGW acts as a central hub with transitive routing. 10 VPCs = 10 attachments. Also connects VPN and Direct Connect.',
    tip: 'Formula: N VPCs need N×(N-1)/2 peering connections. 10 VPCs = 45. Transit Gateway = 10. Any "many VPCs" question → Transit Gateway.',
