  {
    name: 'Zero-Shot Prompting',
    icon: '🎯',
    what: 'Ask the model to perform a task with no examples — rely entirely on knowledge from pre-training.',
    when: 'Simple, well-defined tasks where the model already understands the domain. Best first attempt before adding examples.',
    example: `Classify the sentiment of the following customer review as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

Review: "The setup was straightforward but the battery life is disappointing."

Sentiment:`,
    examTip: 'Zero-shot works because FMs are trained on vast text corpora and generalize well. It is the cheapest approach — no examples consume context window tokens. If zero-shot fails, escalate to few-shot before fine-tuning.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Few-Shot Prompting',
    icon: '📋',
    what: 'Provide 2–5 labeled input-output examples in the prompt to demonstrate the desired pattern before the actual request.',
    when: 'When zero-shot produces inconsistent or incorrect outputs. The examples teach the model your specific format, style, or classification schema.',
    example: `Classify sentiment as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

Review: "Arrived on time, exactly as described." → POSITIVE
Review: "Broke after two days of use." → NEGATIVE
Review: "It works fine, nothing special." → NEUTRAL

Review: "The setup was straightforward but the battery life is disappointing." → `,
    examTip: 'Few-shot is the most commonly tested prompting technique on AIF-C01. Key insight: examples must be representative and correctly labeled — poor examples actively harm performance. 3–5 examples is typically optimal; more is not always better.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Chain-of-Thought (CoT)',
    icon: '🔗',
    what: 'Instruct the model to reason through a problem step by step before producing the final answer. Externalizes the reasoning process.',
    when: 'Multi-step reasoning tasks: math problems, logical deduction, complex classification where intermediate steps matter. Significantly improves accuracy on hard tasks.',
    example: `A company has 3 EC2 instances in us-east-1a and 2 in us-east-1b.
If us-east-1a becomes unavailable, what percentage of capacity remains?

Think through this step by step before answering.`,
    examTip: 'The phrase "think step by step" or "let\'s work through this" in the prompt activates CoT reasoning. CoT trades latency and token cost for accuracy on complex problems. Zero-shot CoT (just add "think step by step") often works as well as providing reasoning examples.',
  },
  {
    name: 'ReAct Prompting (Reason + Act)',
    icon: '⚡',
    what: 'A framework where the model interleaves reasoning steps (Thought) with action calls (Act) and observes the results (Observation) to iteratively solve complex tasks. The backbone of agentic AI systems.',
    when: 'Multi-step agentic tasks that require using external tools, APIs, or databases. When the model must plan, execute, and adapt based on intermediate results.',
    example: `Task: Find the current EC2 pricing for t3.medium in us-east-1 and calculate
the monthly cost for 5 instances running 24/7.

Thought: I need to look up current EC2 pricing first.
Action: get_ec2_price(instance_type="t3.medium", region="us-east-1")
Observation: $0.0416/hour

Thought: Now calculate: 5 instances × $0.0416 × 24 hours × 30 days
Action: calculate(expression="5 * 0.0416 * 24 * 30")
Observation: $149.76

Answer: Monthly cost for 5 × t3.medium = $149.76`,
    examTip: 'ReAct is the pattern behind Amazon Bedrock Agents. When AIF-C01 asks about how Bedrock Agents plan and execute multi-step tasks, the answer is ReAct. The agent loop: Thought → Action → Observation → repeat until done. Each "Action" is a call to an Action Group (Lambda function or API).',
  },
  {
    name: 'Prompt Chaining',
    icon: '⛓️',
    what: 'Break a complex task into a sequence of smaller prompts where the output of each step feeds as input into the next. Each prompt is simpler and more focused than a single mega-prompt.',
    when: 'Long, multi-stage workflows: research → draft → edit → format. When a single prompt would exceed context limits or produce inconsistent results. Common in document processing pipelines.',
    example: `// Step 1 — Extract key facts
Prompt: "Extract the 5 most important facts from this earnings call transcript: [...]"
Output: [fact_1, fact_2, fact_3, fact_4, fact_5]

// Step 2 — Draft summary using facts
Prompt: "Write a 3-sentence executive summary using ONLY these facts: {step_1_output}"
Output: [draft_summary]

// Step 3 — Adjust tone
Prompt: "Rewrite this summary for a non-technical board audience: {step_2_output}"
Output: [final_summary]`,
    examTip: 'AIF-C01 may ask which pattern reduces hallucination and improves output quality for complex tasks without fine-tuning. Prompt chaining is correct — each step is verifiable and can be validated before proceeding. It is the architectural alternative to one massive prompt.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Tree of Thought (ToT)',
    icon: '🌳',
    what: 'An advanced extension of Chain-of-Thought where the model explores multiple reasoning branches in parallel, evaluates each path, and selects the best trajectory to the final answer.',
    when: 'Problems with multiple valid solution paths: strategic planning, creative problem-solving, optimization scenarios where exploring alternatives before committing improves outcome quality.',
    example: `Problem: Design a cost-optimized architecture for a startup with
unpredictable traffic and a $500/month AWS budget.

Branch A — Serverless first:
  → Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB
  → Pros: no idle cost, scales to zero
  → Cons: cold starts, vendor lock-in
  → Feasibility: HIGH

Branch B — Container-based:
  → ECS Fargate + Aurora Serverless
  → Pros: portable, powerful
  → Cons: minimum cost even at idle
  → Feasibility: MEDIUM

Evaluation: Branch A better fits budget constraint.
Final answer: Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB`,
    examTip: 'Tree of Thought is conceptually tested on AIF-C01 as an advanced prompting technique for complex reasoning. Key distinguisher from CoT: CoT = single reasoning chain. ToT = multiple parallel branches with evaluation and selection. ToT requires more tokens and latency but outperforms CoT on planning tasks.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Role / Persona Prompting',
    icon: '🎭',
    what: 'Assign the model a specific role, persona, or expertise level to shape its tone, vocabulary, and reasoning approach.',
    when: 'When you need domain-specific expertise, a consistent communication style, or audience-appropriate explanations. Common in customer-facing applications.',
    example: `You are an expert AWS Solutions Architect with 10 years of experience
designing highly available, cost-optimized cloud architectures.
You explain complex concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

A startup CTO asks: "Should we use RDS or DynamoDB for our e-commerce platform?"

Provide a clear recommendation with reasoning.`,
    examTip: 'Role prompting is set in the system prompt, not the user prompt. The system prompt establishes persistent context across the conversation. Bedrock supports system prompts via the "system" field in the API request — distinct from the user message.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Instruction Prompting',
    icon: '📐',
    what: 'Provide explicit, precise instructions about what the model should and should not do — format, length, style, scope, and constraints.',
    when: 'Whenever you need consistent, predictable output structure. Essential for production systems where downstream parsing depends on a fixed format.',
    example: `Summarize the following AWS re:Invent session transcript.

Rules:
- Maximum 3 bullet points
- Each bullet must be under 20 words
- Focus only on new AWS service announcements
- Do not include speaker names or session details
- Use present tense

Transcript: [...]`,
    examTip: 'Negative instructions ("do not include...") are as important as positive ones. Be explicit about format — "respond in valid JSON" is better than "use a structured format." Ambiguous instructions produce ambiguous outputs.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Context Injection (RAG Prompting)',
    icon: '📚',
    what: 'Inject retrieved documents or facts directly into the prompt as context before asking the model to generate a response grounded in that material.',
    when: 'When the answer depends on specific, current, or proprietary information the model was not trained on. The foundation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).',
    example: `Use ONLY the following AWS documentation excerpt to answer the question.
If the answer is not in the excerpt, say "I don't have enough information."

Context:
"""
Amazon S3 Object Lock enables you to store objects using a write-once-read-many
(WORM) model. Object Lock can prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten
for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
"""

Question: Can S3 Object Lock prevent an administrator from deleting an object?`,
    examTip: 'The instruction "Use ONLY the following context" prevents the model from mixing retrieved facts with hallucinated training knowledge. Bedrock Knowledge Bases automates this pattern. The Guardrails "grounding check" verifies responses are faithful to the retrieved context.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Structured Output Prompting',
    icon: '🏗️',
    what: 'Explicitly instruct the model to respond in a specific machine-readable format — JSON, XML, Markdown table, CSV — to enable reliable downstream parsing.',
    when: 'When the FM output feeds into an automated pipeline, API response, or database. Unstructured responses cannot be reliably parsed programmatically.',
    example: `Extract the following information from the support ticket and return ONLY valid JSON.
Do not include any explanation or text outside the JSON object.

Required fields: customer_name, issue_category, severity (low/medium/high),
product_mentioned, requires_callback (true/false)

Support ticket: "Hi, I'm Sarah from Acme Corp. Our production S3 bucket
became publicly accessible this morning and we need immediate help."

JSON:`,
    examTip: 'Adding "return ONLY valid JSON" and "do not include any text outside the JSON" significantly reduces formatting errors. Some models support a "response format" parameter (JSON mode) that enforces valid JSON at the inference level — available in Amazon Bedrock for supported models.',

    lowValue: 'Temperature 0–0.3: deterministic, focused, factual. Same prompt → same output every time. Use for factual Q&A, data extraction, classification, structured output.',
    highValue: 'Temperature 0.7–1.0+: creative, varied, unpredictable. Same prompt → different outputs each run. Use for creative writing, brainstorming, generating diverse options.',
    defaultTip: 'Most production applications use 0.1–0.7. Temperature 0 is not always exactly deterministic due to floating-point arithmetic differences.',
    examTip: 'AIF-C01 tests temperature direction: "to get more consistent, factual answers → lower temperature." "To reduce hallucinations → lower temperature (plus RAG)." Temperature does not affect what the model knows — only how it samples from what it knows.',

    icon: '🎯',
    range: '0.0 → 1.0',
    what: 'Restricts sampling to the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p. Instead of considering all vocabulary tokens, only the "nucleus" — the most probable tokens summing to p — are candidates for selection.',
    lowValue: 'Top-p 0.1–0.5: conservative, high-confidence tokens only. Model sticks to its most likely completions. Reduces surprising or off-topic outputs.',
    highValue: 'Top-p 0.9–1.0: considers a broad vocabulary. More creative and diverse outputs. Top-p 1.0 = all tokens eligible (no nucleus restriction).',
    defaultTip: 'Top-p 0.9 is a common default. Tuning both temperature AND top-p simultaneously is generally not recommended — adjust one at a time. Top-p tends to be more intuitive than top-k for most use cases.',
    examTip: 'Distinguish top-p from top-k: top-p = dynamic vocabulary based on probability mass. top-k = fixed vocabulary size of k tokens regardless of probabilities. Both control output diversity but work differently.',

    lowValue: 'Top-k 1: greedy decoding — always picks the highest-probability token. Completely deterministic. Equivalent to temperature 0.',
    highValue: 'Top-k 50–200: broad vocabulary, more creative diversity. Allows the model to explore less obvious but valid continuations.',
    defaultTip: 'Top-k 40–50 is a common starting point. Unlike top-p, top-k uses a fixed cutoff that does not adapt to the probability distribution shape.',
    examTip: 'AIF-C01 may ask: "Which parameter limits the model to choosing among the N most probable next tokens?" Answer: top-k. Key contrast: top-k = fixed count. top-p = dynamic based on probability threshold.',

    lowValue: 'Low max tokens (50–200): forces concise responses. Useful for classification labels, short summaries, or slot extraction where verbosity wastes tokens.',
    highValue: 'High max tokens (1,000–4,000): allows long-form generation. Necessary for detailed reports, long-form content, or complex reasoning chains.',
    defaultTip: 'Max tokens limits output length only — it does not reduce the input context window consumed. Setting max tokens too low truncates the response mid-sentence. Cost = (input tokens + output tokens) × price per token.',
    examTip: 'AIF-C01 distinguishes max tokens from context window: context window = total tokens in + out the model can process. Max tokens = cap on output tokens only. If context window is 100K and input is 90K tokens, max tokens cannot exceed ~10K.',

    highValue: 'Custom stop sequences: e.g., ["\\n\\n", "END", "###"]. Useful when generating structured content where you know exactly where the response should end.',
    defaultTip: 'Common use: structured generation where you want exactly one JSON object → stop at "}". Or few-shot prompting where you want only the completion for the last example → stop at the next "Review:" prefix.',

    lowValue: 'Repetition penalty 1.0: no penalty — model freely repeats tokens. Normal behavior for short outputs but can cause looping in long generation.',
    highValue: 'Repetition penalty 1.3–2.0: strongly discourages repetition. Forces lexical diversity. Risk of introducing less natural phrasing if set too high.',
    defaultTip: 'A value of 1.1–1.2 is a safe starting point for most generation tasks. Use higher values (1.3+) only when the model produces visibly repetitive loops. Similar concept: "frequency penalty" and "presence penalty" in some APIs.',
