// ─── DECISION MATRIX ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
interface MatrixRow { requirement: string; solution: string; why: string }

const MATRIX: MatrixRow[] = [
  // Cloud Concepts
  { requirement: 'Run servers without buying physical hardware', solution: 'Cloud Computing (IaaS)', why: 'On-demand access to compute, storage, and networking over the internet. Pay-as-you-go model eliminates upfront CapEx.' },
  { requirement: 'Scale instantly to handle traffic spikes', solution: 'Elasticity / Auto Scaling', why: 'Cloud resources expand and contract on demand. Traditional data centers are fixed capacity and cannot react instantly.' },
  { requirement: 'Go global in minutes / deploy to multiple regions', solution: 'AWS Global Infrastructure', why: '30+ Regions, 100+ AZs worldwide. Deploy your app to any region with a few clicks — months faster than building a data center.' },
  { requirement: 'Reduce capital expenditure / no upfront cost', solution: 'OpEx model (pay-as-you-go)', why: 'Cloud trades large CapEx (servers, facilities) for small, variable OpEx (monthly bill). No depreciation, no over-provisioning.' },
  { requirement: 'Deploy to private company data center only', solution: 'Private Cloud / On-Premises', why: 'All infrastructure managed and owned by the organisation. Maximum control, but highest cost and least elasticity.' },
  { requirement: 'Keep sensitive workloads on-prem + use cloud for bursting', solution: 'Hybrid Cloud', why: 'Hybrid connects on-premises infrastructure to AWS. Sensitive data stays local; elastic workloads burst to cloud.' },
  { requirement: 'Use software without installing or managing it', solution: 'SaaS (Software as a Service)', why: 'Provider manages everything — hardware, OS, middleware, application. You just use the software (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce, Amazon Chime).' },
  { requirement: 'Deploy on a managed platform — no OS patches', solution: 'PaaS (Platform as a Service)', why: 'Provider manages OS, runtime, scaling. You deploy code only. Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Amplify.' },
  { requirement: 'Rent raw compute / storage / networking — manage OS yourself', solution: 'IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)', why: 'Provider manages physical hardware and virtualisation. You manage OS, middleware, applications. Example: Amazon EC2.' },

  // Compute
  { requirement: 'Run virtual servers / full OS control', solution: 'Amazon EC2', why: 'EC2 = resizable compute capacity. You choose instance type, OS, and software. Best for apps needing full control of the environment.' },
  { requirement: 'Run code in response to events / no server management', solution: 'AWS Lambda', why: 'Serverless compute. Pay only per request and duration. Max 15 minutes. Perfect for event-driven, short-duration tasks.' },
  { requirement: 'Run containerised applications at scale', solution: 'Amazon ECS or EKS with Fargate', why: 'ECS = AWS-native container orchestration. EKS = Kubernetes. Fargate = serverless (no EC2 to manage). Choose Fargate for simplest ops.' },
  { requirement: 'Deploy web app without managing infrastructure / PaaS', solution: 'AWS Elastic Beanstalk', why: 'Upload your code; Beanstalk handles EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, RDS provisioning. You keep full control but skip manual setup.' },
  { requirement: 'Run short-term, interruptible batch workloads cheaply', solution: 'EC2 Spot Instances', why: 'Spot = unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount. Can be interrupted with 2-min notice. Use for fault-tolerant, flexible jobs.' },
  { requirement: 'Commit to 1 or 3 years of compute for discount', solution: 'EC2 Reserved Instances / Savings Plans', why: 'Reserved Instances: up to 72% off On-Demand for committed steady-state workloads. Savings Plans: more flexible, covers Lambda too.' },

  // Storage
  { requirement: 'Store and retrieve any amount of data / objects', solution: 'Amazon S3', why: 'Object storage. Unlimited capacity. 11 nines durability. Ideal for files, images, backups, data lakes, static websites.' },
  { requirement: 'Store data accessed frequently (fast retrieval)', solution: 'S3 Standard', why: 'Default storage class. High durability, availability, and performance for frequently accessed data. Most expensive per-GB but no retrieval fee.' },
  { requirement: 'Store data accessed once or twice a month / lower cost', solution: 'S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)', why: 'Lower storage cost than S3 Standard but charges per retrieval. Best when data is important but accessed infrequently.' },
  { requirement: 'Archive data rarely accessed / cheapest long-term storage', solution: 'S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval / Deep Archive', why: 'Glacier = minutes-to-hours retrieval. Deep Archive = 12+ hours. Lowest cost storage on AWS. For compliance/regulatory archives.' },
  { requirement: 'Store EC2 operating system disk / database files', solution: 'Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)', why: 'Block storage attached to a single EC2 instance. Persistent. Like a hard drive. Required for the OS and database volumes.' },
  { requirement: 'Share files across many Linux EC2 instances simultaneously', solution: 'Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)', why: 'Network file system (NFS). Multiple EC2s read/write at once. Auto-scales. For shared application data, CMS, home directories.' },
  { requirement: 'Move petabytes of data offline to AWS', solution: 'AWS Snowball Edge', why: 'Physical device shipped to your location. Faster and cheaper than internet for massive datasets or limited bandwidth environments.' },

  // Database
  { requirement: 'Managed relational database / MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL', solution: 'Amazon RDS', why: 'Managed relational DB. AWS handles backups, patching, Multi-AZ failover. Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB.' },
  { requirement: 'Serverless key-value / NoSQL database at any scale', solution: 'Amazon DynamoDB', why: 'Fully managed NoSQL. Single-digit millisecond latency. Auto-scales. No schema. Perfect for high-traffic, flexible data models.' },
  { requirement: 'Analyze petabytes of data with SQL / BI / data warehouse', solution: 'Amazon Redshift', why: 'Columnar data warehouse. Optimised for analytics (OLAP), not transactions (OLTP). Massively parallel — queries millions of rows fast.' },

  // Networking
  { requirement: 'Isolate AWS resources in a private network', solution: 'Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)', why: 'Logically isolated network within AWS. You define IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and security. Default VPC provided per region.' },
  { requirement: 'Deliver content to global users with low latency', solution: 'Amazon CloudFront (CDN)', why: 'Content Delivery Network. Caches content at 400+ edge locations worldwide. Reduces latency for images, videos, APIs.' },
  { requirement: 'Route internet traffic to AWS resources / DNS management', solution: 'Amazon Route 53', why: 'Scalable DNS service. Translates domain names to IP addresses. Supports routing policies: latency, failover, geolocation.' },
  { requirement: 'Connect on-premises data center to AWS privately', solution: 'AWS Direct Connect', why: 'Dedicated private fiber connection from your facility to AWS. More consistent throughput and lower latency than VPN over internet.' },

  // Security
  { requirement: 'Control who can access AWS services / manage permissions', solution: 'AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)', why: 'Create users, groups, roles, and policies. Principle of least privilege. Root account should be secured immediately with MFA.' },
  { requirement: 'Protect web applications from SQL injection and XSS', solution: 'AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)', why: 'Filters malicious Layer 7 HTTP traffic. Attach to ALB, CloudFront, or API Gateway. Uses rule-based allow/deny lists.' },
  { requirement: 'Protect against DDoS attacks', solution: 'AWS Shield', why: 'Shield Standard = free, automatic protection against common attacks. Shield Advanced = paid, 24/7 DRT, cost protection, L7 mitigation.' },
  { requirement: 'Detect threats and unusual behaviour automatically', solution: 'Amazon GuardDuty', why: 'Continuous threat detection using ML. Analyses VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, DNS queries. No agents needed. Alerts within minutes.' },
  { requirement: 'Audit API calls / track who did what in your account', solution: 'AWS CloudTrail', why: 'Records every API call: who, what resource, when, from where. Required for security forensics, compliance, and change tracking.' },
  { requirement: 'Check compliance / resource configuration history', solution: 'AWS Config', why: 'Records resource configuration state over time. Evaluates compliance against rules. Alerts when config drifts from desired state.' },
  { requirement: 'Store and automatically rotate database passwords', solution: 'AWS Secrets Manager', why: 'Stores and rotates secrets (DB credentials, API keys) automatically. Native RDS integration. ~$0.40/secret/month.' },
  { requirement: 'Free vulnerability scanning / security recommendations', solution: 'AWS Trusted Advisor', why: 'Checks account for security, cost, performance, reliability, and service limit issues. Basic checks free; all checks require Business/Enterprise support.' },

  // Billing & Cost
  { requirement: 'Understand and forecast AWS spend', solution: 'AWS Cost Explorer', why: 'Visualise spending by service, region, tag, or linked account. Forecast future costs. Identify anomalies and cost drivers.' },
  { requirement: 'Get alerts when spending exceeds a threshold', solution: 'AWS Budgets', why: 'Set cost, usage, or reservation budgets. Send SNS/email alerts when actual or forecasted spend exceeds thresholds.' },
  { requirement: 'Consolidate billing for multiple AWS accounts', solution: 'AWS Organizations / Consolidated Billing', why: 'One monthly bill for all accounts. Volume discounts aggregated across accounts. Member accounts inherit payment from management account.' },
  { requirement: 'Estimate cost of a planned AWS architecture', solution: 'AWS Pricing Calculator', why: 'Free web tool to model your architecture and estimate monthly cost before you build anything. No sign-in required.' },
  { requirement: 'Optimise costs / find underutilised resources', solution: 'AWS Trusted Advisor + Cost Explorer', why: 'Trusted Advisor flags underutilised EC2, idle RDS, and unattached EBS. Cost Explorer rightsizing shows savings opportunities.' },

  // Support Plans
  { requirement: 'Fastest 24/7 AWS support with dedicated TAM', solution: 'Enterprise Support (or Enterprise On-Ramp)', why: 'Enterprise: <15 min critical response, dedicated Technical Account Manager. Enterprise On-Ramp: pool of TAMs, <30 min critical.' },
  { requirement: 'Business-hours support for production issues', solution: 'Business Support Plan', why: 'Business: 24/7 access, <1 hr critical response, full Trusted Advisor checks, AWS Health API, IEM (paid extra). $100/month minimum.' },
  { requirement: 'Cheapest paid plan with 12-hour business-hours response', solution: 'Developer Support Plan', why: 'Developer: business hours only, 1 primary contact, <12 hr general response. Good for testing and development environments.' },

    wrong: 'AWS is responsible for everything in the cloud',
    wrongWhy: 'AWS only manages security OF the cloud (hardware, network, physical data centres). The customer is always responsible for what they put IN the cloud.',
    correct: 'AWS = security OF the cloud. Customer = security IN the cloud.',
    correctWhy: 'AWS owns: hardware, facilities, physical network, hypervisor, managed service availability. Customer owns: OS patches, IAM policies, encryption of data, application security, firewall rules they configure.',
    tip: 'If the question is about "who patches the OS" on EC2 → customer (IaaS). On Lambda or RDS → AWS (managed service). Encryption of data at rest is ALWAYS the customer\'s choice, even though AWS provides the tools.',

    correct: 'Business (all Trusted Advisor) or Enterprise (TAM + <15 min)',
    correctWhy: 'Critical response times: Enterprise <15 min, Enterprise On-Ramp <30 min, Business <1 hr, Developer 12 hr (business hours), Basic = no response. Trusted Advisor full checks: Business and above only.',
    tip: 'TAM = Enterprise or Enterprise On-Ramp ONLY. Full Trusted Advisor = Business and above. Any question about 24/7 access with phone support → at least Business tier.',
  },
  {
    title: 'EC2 Pricing — Reserved vs Spot vs Savings Plans',
    icon: '💰',
    trigger: '"Most cost-effective" or "steady-state 24/7 workload" or "interruptible"',
    wrong: 'Spot Instances for a database server',
    wrongWhy: 'Spot instances can be interrupted with only 2 minutes notice. A database cannot be interrupted — data could be corrupted or sessions lost.',
    correct: 'Reserved Instances for predictable 24/7 workloads. Spot for fault-tolerant batch jobs.',
    correctWhy: 'On-Demand = flexible, no commitment. Reserved = commit 1-3 yr for up to 72% off. Spot = 90% off but interruptible. Savings Plans = flexible commitment covering EC2 + Lambda + Fargate.',
    tip: 'If the question mentions "steady", "predictable", "24/7", "database" → Reserved or Savings Plans. "Interruptible", "batch", "flexible" → Spot. "Testing" or "short-term" → On-Demand.',
  },

    icon: '🌍',
    trigger: '"High availability within a city" vs "global distribution" vs "CDN caching"',
    wrong: 'Regions provide redundancy within the same city',
    wrongWhy: 'Regions are separate geographic areas (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1). AZs are the redundancy within a region (multiple data centres in one area).',
    correct: 'AZ = within a region for HA. Region = geographic area. Edge = CloudFront CDN cache.',
    correctWhy: 'AZs are physically isolated data centres within one region (~2-60 ms apart). Deploy across 2+ AZs for high availability. Regions are independent (choose for latency, compliance). Edge Locations serve CloudFront caches globally.',
    tip: '"Deploy in multiple AZs for high availability" ✅. "Deploy in multiple Regions for disaster recovery" ✅. "Edge Locations are NOT AZs or Regions — they only cache content for CloudFront." Exam frequently tests this 3-way distinction.',
  },

    title: 'IAM — Role vs User vs Group',
    icon: '🔑',
    trigger: '"EC2 needs to access S3" or "grant temporary access"',
    wrong: 'Create an IAM user with access keys and put them on the EC2',
    wrongWhy: 'Access keys stored on EC2 are a security risk. They can be found in logs, metadata, or if the instance is compromised. They also do not rotate automatically.',
    correct: 'Attach an IAM Role to the EC2 instance',
    correctWhy: 'IAM Roles provide temporary, automatically rotated credentials via the Instance Metadata Service. No access keys needed. No hardcoded credentials. This is the AWS best practice.',
    tip: 'Any time an AWS service (EC2, Lambda, ECS) needs to access another AWS service → IAM Role. For human users → IAM User or IAM Identity Center (SSO). Never store long-term access keys on an EC2 instance.',
  },

    title: 'S3 Glacier retrieval times — not all the same',
    icon: '🧊',
    trigger: '"Archive storage" or "long-term retention" with a specific retrieval requirement',
    wrong: 'S3 Glacier Deep Archive for data needed within minutes',
    wrongWhy: 'Deep Archive retrieval takes 12-48 hours. If you need minutes-retrieval from a cold tier, you need Glacier Instant Retrieval.',
    correct: 'Match the Glacier tier to the retrieval SLA: Instant (ms), Flexible (1-12 hr), Deep Archive (12-48 hr)',
    correctWhy: 'S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval = millisecond access (like Standard-IA but cheaper storage). Flexible Retrieval = minutes to 12 hours. Deep Archive = 12-48 hours, cheapest.',
    tip: 'Trick question: "Glacier" alone is ambiguous. Look for: "milliseconds" → Instant. "Within a few minutes/hours" → Flexible. "Rarely accessed compliance archive" → Deep Archive. Cost goes down; retrieval time goes up.',
